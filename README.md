# Basic RPG



## Notes about this project
- Combat has been included
- Needs items to be added
- Loops are depricated and need streams
- Needs a front end as typing is full of isses and bugs (boring)
- The enemies respawn every second and do not force battle
- The equipment yeilds no benefit
- The methods contain too much logic for troubleshooting
- The main class has too much logic in it
### New repositiory will be created addressing these issues
